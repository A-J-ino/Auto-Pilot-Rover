# Auto-Pilot-Rover
This a project created for national science day. It is a rover which is self driven and has object avoidance feature . Once the rover detects an object within 1 inch of distance it would move back, turn left to search for a direction where the there is no object wiithin one inch. once it finds a route which is free from objects within that distance it would continue to move forward in that direction. This is possible by the use of arduino and a sonar sensor.
programed using the arduino language.
